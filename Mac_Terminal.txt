- On macOS 10.15 Catalina and later, the default Terminal shell switch from the bash (Bourne-again shell) to zsh (Z shell).
- For bash shell, we can put the environment variables at ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc.
- For zsh shell, we can put the environment variables at ~/.zshenv or ~/.zshrc.
- We can print the $SHELL environment variable to determine the current shell you are using.
	- echo $SHELL
- If MacOS doesn't allow installation;
	- Goto System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General
	- Click on 'Allow Anyway' button
	- run command or dmg file again
	- A popup window will open asking for a permission to open the blocked file
